### First Day of 30 days of JS challenge
- I watched the tutorial from WesBos and tried to re-create the "JavaScript Drum Kit" but in a way I know how. 
- Lots of room for improvement and a LOT of knocking the rust off but this is fun. I hope to continue and make them all more clean and functional.
